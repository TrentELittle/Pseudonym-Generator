# Pseudonym-Generator

This is a simple project to practice some of the fundamentals of python and programming logic.

## What the project contains

1. Creation of two list of names
2. Randomly select one name from each list to create an alias with a 'first' and 'last' name.
3. Allow user to generate as many aliases as they want before closing out of the program.

note: You can use an list of names to make it as different or silly as you want. I decided to use a list of colors for the first name and a list of common house plants for the last name.

## Future improvement
There are many ways to improve on this idea if desired. For example, a simple time delay between asking the user to generate the name and actually generating the name could make the experience a bit better. Another idea is to create an interactive dashboard or application that does all of this outside of the command line. As stated there are many directions that could be taken with this idea.
